## Backstory 
Tanner crabs were captured and brought back in the lab to be tested for the presence of bitter crab disease. Crabs were then placed in three different temperature treatments to examine how temperature influences disease progression.

## Data Wrangling Problem
There are a lot of crabs. We have intitial design data including presumed disease state (cPCR), quantitative PCR confirming disease status, and RNA levels. We need to decide on which crabs will be used to construct RNA-seq libraries to look at immune response genes.

## The Starting table

Here is what the "Master" looks like. What is wrong here?

## Bringing in data

`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Bringing in data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
    prim_master <- read_csv("../data/20180522-master-all-crabs-hemo-mod3.csv")
```


## Issue?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
knitr::kable(prim_master)
```

## Issue?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
knitr::kable(prim_master)
```


## Where to be at the end?

That is one of the take home messages in terms of thinking through where you want to be.


## Table 2

```{r, echo = TRUE}
first_pcr <- read.csv("../data/20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv")
knitr::kable(first_pcr)
``` 

## Mini-issue

_email_    

>>You can easily add the dates. Any crab with a 37- or 38- prefix in the sample no. was from Day 26 -- those also have tube #s, cuz the aliquots (DNA in RNAlater) came from you. All the crabs with 30- thru 34- were sampled on day 0/1. Make sense?

 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
mutate(first_pcr, sampleday = 
  ifelse(Sample_pre == 37 | Sample_pre == 38, "day26", 
  ifelse(Sample_pre == 30 | Sample_pre == 31 | Sample_pre == 32 | Sample_pre == 33 | Sample_pre == 34, "day01", 
  "unknown"))) 
```

## More

```{r, echo = TRUE}
withDay03 <- read_csv("../analyses/withDay03.csv")
withDay03
```

## Spread

```{r, echo = TRUE}
knitr::kable(
  withDay03 %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(sampleday, Starting_Quantity)
)
```

## Spread and back to dpylr
```{r, echo = TRUE}

PCR_day26 <- withDay03 %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(sampleday, Starting_Quantity) %>% 
  filter(day26 != ' ') %>%
  select(FRP, day26) %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  summarise(Avg_startq_day26 = mean(day26))
```

## What did this do?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(PCR_day26)
```


## Last set of data 

```{r, include = FALSE}
RNAdata <- read_csv("../analyses/20180524_RNA.csv")
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(RNAdata)
```

## Sample day as column

```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(
  RNAdata %>% mutate(record_id = row_number()) %>% 
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(Sample_Day, RNA_conc) %>% 
  rename(RNAday9 = "9", RNAday12 = "12", RNAday26 = "26" ) %>% 
  filter(RNAday9 != 0) %>% 
  select(FRP, infection_status, temperature_treatment, RNAday9))
```

## Now what?




## Putting it all together

```{r, include = FALSE}
PCR_day01 <- withDay03 %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(sampleday, Starting_Quantity) %>% 
  filter(day01 != ' ') %>%
  select(FRP, day01) %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  summarise(Avg_startq_day01 = mean(day01))

day9RNA <- RNAdata %>% mutate(record_id = row_number()) %>% 
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(Sample_Day, RNA_conc) %>% 
  rename(RNAday9 = "9", RNAday12 = "12", RNAday26 = "26" ) %>% 
  filter(RNAday9 != 0) %>% 
  select(FRP, infection_status, temperature_treatment, RNAday9)


day12RNA <- RNAdata %>% mutate(record_id = row_number()) %>% 
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(Sample_Day, RNA_conc) %>% 
  rename(RNAday9 = "9", RNAday12 = "12", RNAday26 = "26" ) %>% 
  filter(RNAday12 != 0) %>% 
  select(FRP, RNAday12)


day26RNA <- RNAdata %>% mutate(record_id = row_number()) %>% 
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  spread(Sample_Day, RNA_conc) %>% 
  rename(RNAday9 = "9", RNAday12 = "12", RNAday26 = "26" ) %>% 
  filter(RNAday26 != 0) %>%
  select(FRP, RNAday26)

```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
left_join(prim_master, PCR_day01, by ="FRP") %>%
  left_join(PCR_day26, by ="FRP") %>%
  left_join(day9RNA, by ="FRP") %>%
  left_join(day12RNA, by ="FRP") %>%
  left_join(day26RNA, by ="FRP") %>%
  filter(RNAday9 > 0 | RNAday12 > 0 | RNAday26 > 0)
```



## Summary

* We went into `dplyr` with "tidy" data
* Here we see application of `tidyr` with more real example. 
* Going forward be familar with `dplyr` and `tidyr` and take time to envision end product.
* Work in steps
* Slides are another cool feature in Rstudio, that builds on Rmarkdown.


## This week 

The primary activity this week will be generating slides! This is based on the Rmarkdown we worked on last week. Generate at least 5 slides. Slides should

* describe your data (prose)
* show the data
* show code where you manipulate data in some fashion (hint: echo=true)
* have at least 1 plot
* include an image
* include bullets
* Using tidyr, manipulate your dataset in at least one meaningful way
